      <description>January has flown by in a blink of an eye! While 2025 is already into its second month, it&amp;rsquo;s lunar new year today, so I decided to write a review of 2024.
Research 2024 was a year filled with deadlines after deadlines. From January 2024 to January 2025, I submitted three different papers a total of four times, went through four rebuttals, and had two papers accepted. The last one is currently under review.</description>

      <description>This is a personal note for the ACM CCS 2024 I made after the event. CCS 2024 was held in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. It was my second time attending CCS, but this time I had the privilege of presenting my work.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of 2023, and as I look back on the year, I can only say that it was a year full of research. I remember the days spent in front of the computer, reading papers, and conducting experiments. Of course, there were other events this year, including the creation of this blog (yay!). So, I decided it would be nice to write a review of 2023, to reflect on this year and to prepare for the next year.</description>

      <title>Series: Graduate School Productivity - Introduction</title>

      <description>Time flies in graduate school! Having spent 3.5 years as a PhD student, one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that I should be super-efficient in managing my time and energy.
I&amp;rsquo;m not someone you&amp;rsquo;d label as &amp;ldquo;born productive&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m a typical &amp;ldquo;P&amp;rdquo;-type person according to Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)&amp;ndash;indicative of a spontaneous and flexible nature. As many P-type people do, I&amp;rsquo;m prone to distraction and have difficulty in sticking to routines. Daily to-do lists or planners are ways to self-torture by confining free will into a fixed schedule.</description>
