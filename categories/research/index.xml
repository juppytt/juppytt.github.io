      <description>From August 5th to 12nd 2024, I attended Black Hat USA 2024 (and Defcon 2024) in Las Vegas. I presented my research on Bypassing MTE with a side-channel attack. I returned to Korea this morning (luckily, no jet lag) and am writing this post to share my experiences from Las Vegas before I forget them.
Black Hat USA 2024 First Black Hat experience I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Black Hat before, so I was very excited, especially since I was going to present for the first time in an international conference.</description>

      <description>Introduction In recent years, emerging technology in Machine Learning and Large Language Model (LLM) had led to the development of ML/LLM-powered applications. One of the popular service for ML/LLM application is Hugging Face. In this post, I would like to describe the potential security risks in current Hugging Face, especially in Spaces.
Hugging Face Hugging Face is a AI community that provides a lot of machine learning models, datasets, and applications.</description>

      <description>Intro In the first year of my Ph.D, I ambitiously began a research on protecting the Linux kernel against data-only attacks. My research especially focused on protecting security-critical objects and pointers leveraging the ARM&amp;rsquo;s upcoming hardware security features (PAC and MTE).
Building such a kernel hardening system required me to tackle several key issues:
Cross-compiling the kernel (X86 -&amp;gt; ARM64) Cross-module kernel analysis Linux kernel instrumentation Connecting the cross-module analysis with kernel build system.</description>
