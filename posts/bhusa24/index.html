Black Hat USA 2024
First Black Hat experience
I&rsquo;ve never been to Black Hat before, so I was very excited, especially
since I was going to present for the first time in an international
conference. There were lots of people, great talks, and free food and
drinks :blue_heart:. Some gifts were also given: a Black Hat
backpack, which I found very practical and useful, a tumblr with a
straw, and a badge.'>

  <p>From August 5th to 12nd 2024, I attended Black Hat USA 2024 (and
Defcon 32) in Las Vegas. I presented my research on <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/briefings/schedule/#bypassing-arms-memory-tagging-extension-with-a-side-channel-attack-38669">Bypassing MTE
with a side-channel
attack</a>.
I returned to Korea this morning (luckily, no jet lag) and am writing
this post to share my experiences from Las Vegas before I forget them.</p>
<h1 id="black-hat-usa-2024">Black Hat USA 2024</h1>
<h2 id="first-black-hat-experience">First Black Hat experience</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Black Hat before, so I was very excited, especially
since I was going to present for the first time in an international
conference. There were lots of people, great talks, and free food and
drinks :blue_heart:. Some gifts were also given: a Black Hat
backpack, which I found very practical and useful, a tumblr with a
straw, and a badge.</p>
<p>I also attended the speaker VIP party prior to the conference, where I
had the chance to meet many researchers and security experts in
person. It was so exciting to meet professionals I&rsquo;ve only seen in
papers.</p>
<p>For the sake of networking, I did try to connect with others, and I
think it was quite successful. Since English is not my first language,
it&rsquo;s always challenging to communicate at such parties, but I was
fairly able to communicate with others (shoutout to all my online
English tutors!). However, I still feel like I need to expand my
vocabulary to express my thoughts more clearly.</p>
<p>Regarding the venue, it was huge, so I had to walk a lot. I was
exhausted every day because I only brought shoes with hard soles. I
should have brought more comfortable shoes for walking. The business
hall had many company booths where I could get free t-shirts and
other company swags. I wanted to visit more booths but couldn&rsquo;t being
busy with my talk and other things.</p>
<p>Despite the venue&rsquo;s size, the briefing sessions weren&rsquo;t as crowded as
I expected. I&rsquo;ve heard that the briefings were usually packed (about
10 years ago), but the session halls had plenty of empty seats. I
only saw people lining up once, for the &ldquo;15 ways to Break your
Copilot&rdquo; talk (does everyone want to break Copilot?). But most talks
weren&rsquo;t even half full.</p>
<p>Among the 5-6 talks I attended, some were really interesting and tackled
the specific subjects I&rsquo;m working on at the moment. It assured me that
I was doing relevant research, but it also made me think I need to
push our projects harder to complete them before someone else does
:face_with_spiral_eyes:.</p>
<p>I found LLM security talk by Richard Harang (Nvidia) very fascinating.
Not only was the content excellent, but the way he presented was also
very engaging.</p>
<h2 id="my-talk">My talk</h2>
<p>As a first-time speaker, I was quite nervous about my talk,
especially since Black Hat is a non-academic conference with a large
and diverse audience. Before the conference, my advisor and I had
many discussions about the content and visuals to make it easy to
follow for the general audience. We also had multiple rounds of
rehearsals.</p>
<p>At the conference, before my talk, I had a scheduled interview with
Dark Reading. I expected it to be a simple, brief session that would
be published as an article later. But it turned out to be a news
desk-style live interview with a camera crew! I was so nervous
because I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be <em>live</em>, and I hadn&rsquo;t prepared for
that at all. It was the most overwhelming experience I had on this
trip. Well, I think I did my best, staying calm and answering the
questions somehow&hellip; :sweat_smile:</p>
<p>On the day of the presentation, I felt quite confident&ndash;maybe because
I had practiced a lot and had already gone through the anxiety of the
live interview. I was also kind of tired of being nervous since my
talk was scheduled at the afternoon of the last day. So I thought,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care anymore. I just want to finish this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The talk went successful. I think I even enjoyed the feeling of being
on stage and having the audience&rsquo;s attention (?!). The audience seemed
engaged in my talk (no one appeared to be dozing off or leaving the
hall). Some gave me positive feedback afterward, which I greatly
appreciated and made me feel all the effort was worth it. I received
many questions as well and was genuinely happy to see that my research
was interesting to many people.</p>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed presenting at Black Hat USA and highly
recommend it. I loved the feeling of being on stage and all the
speaker privileges from BlackHat. I definitely want to present at
Black Hat again!</p>
<h1 id="other-experiences">Other experiences</h1>
<p>A few other things I did during the trip.</p>
<h2 id="google-0x0g-party">Google 0x0g party</h2>
<p>During this trip, I attended the Google 0x0g party (Google
Vulnerability Reward Program party). It was my first time attending
such an event, and there were so many security engineers from Google
and various companies. The party featured programs with talks and
events, but it was mainly about networking and socializing. I got to
meet people around the industry, and overall, it was a great
experience.</p>
<p>Since I had given my talk about bypassing MTE the day before, I had
some conversations about it. Opinions on MTE were quite divided
across the industry, even within Google. Some were very positive
about MTE, while others are quite negative, with some suggesting that
MTE could be deprecated (?). This was interesting to me because, in
academia, particularly in systems security, MTE is generally
considered as a promising direction for future security, as long as
the cost is not too high. The cost is indeed a significant issue, but
the Pixel 8 series has demonstrated that <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/11/first-handset-with-mte-on-market.html">MTE&rsquo;s performance overhead
is
negligible</a>.
I also have a paper under review that leverages MTE for attack
mitigation. Unfortunately, it has gone through the review process at
top-tier security conferences about 4-5 times, but no reviewer raised
concerns about the feasibility of MTE as a defense so far.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing I picked up, not only from this party but
also from other people I&rsquo;ve met in the past, is that high-end IOT
device manufacturers are generally more positive about MTE. I&rsquo;ve
heard that Amazon is considering MTE for their future devices, and I
also learned at this event that Meta is considering MTE for future
Oculus devices. I wonder if this is because they are less concerned
about the performance or other costs? In any case, it seems our
researches on MTE is still highly relevant to the industry, and I&rsquo;m
excited to see how it will be adopted in the future.</p>
<h2 id="defcon-2024">Defcon 2024</h2>
<p>Defcon felt a lot less organized than BlackHat. As a non-CTF player, I
didn&rsquo;t find much to do at Defcon. I mostly wandered around some of the
villages and attended a talk about bypassing Copilot (again, by a
different speaker). Then I spent some time at the Car Hacking Village,
where my advisor was participating in the CTF :smile:. I just
watched him play and worked on my own stuff. By that point, I didn&rsquo;t
have much social energy left, so I tried to focus on getting back to
my research.</p>
<p>I also attended the AIxCC closing ceremony, where the winners of the
AIxCC competition were announced. I heard the competition was quite
intense, with participants dedicating a lot of time and resources. I
was happy to see few teams I know win the competition and move on to
the final round. I really wanted to see AI beat previous techniques
like fuzzing and symbolic execution, but I think we&rsquo;re not there yet.
Would love to see more progress in this area!</p>
<h2 id="hotels--pools">Hotels &amp; Pools</h2>
<p>I stayed at Mandalay Bay during Black Hat, and Fontainebleau during
Defcon. Both hotels were great, close to each conference venue, and
had nice pools.</p>
<p>Mandalay Bay was a classic hotel with a spacious room. It was a bit
old-fashioned, but the room was clean and comfortable. The hotel was
huge, and I had to walk a lot to get to the conference venue. I think
I didn&rsquo;t had enough time to explore the hotel during Black Hat, but I
did enjoy their pool before checking out.</p>
<p>Mandalay&rsquo;s pool was really nice. On Friday, before we checked out, we
went to the pool, and surprisingly, there weren&rsquo;t many people. With
various pools&ndash;wave pool, lazy river, and regular pool&ndash;it was fun to
hop around and enjoy the sun. Compared to wave pools in Korea,
Mandalay&rsquo;s had smaller waves, but they allowed people to swim in the
deeper areas. While this seemed a bit dangerous for kids and
non-swimmers, I actually had fun swimming in the pool where my feet
couldn&rsquo;t touch the ground.</p>
<p>We wanted to visit Mandalay Bay&rsquo;s pool again after checking out, so
we returned on Monday morning, paying $25 for per person for a pool
pass :joy:. However, Monday was much more crowded, and I couldn&rsquo;t
enjoy the pool as much as I did on Friday. Maybe it was because the
price was cheaper on Monday, or perhaps because Black Hat has ended
and many people were staying at the hotel for vacation. Still, I
enjoyed the pool and got a bit of tan :sunglasses:.</p>
<p>Fontainebleau was much more luxurious than Mandalay Bay. I had seen
some reviews mentioning that the rooms weren&rsquo;t always well-cleaned,
but our room was okay&ndash;maybe not perfect, but acceptable. The room
was a bit smaller than at Mandalay Bay, but the facilities were much
newer and cleaner. They even had USB-C ports on the wall!</p>
<p>Fontainebleau&rsquo;s pool was also nice. Although they didn&rsquo;t have a
variety of pools like Mandalay Bay, the pool was clean and not too
crowded. They also offered free parasols for sunbeds! I had a great
time swimming and relaxing at the pool.</p>
<p>Despite its expensive image, some restaurants at Fontainebleau were
good and reasonably priced, considering the usual costs in Las Vegas.
Our favorite was a Hong Kong-style restaurant called &ldquo;Washing Potato&rdquo;.
We had lunch there twice to enjoy dim sum and noodles :yum:.</p>
<h2 id="casinos">Casinos</h2>
<p>I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t be a fan of casinos, but I actually liked
playing the games. I played blackjack and roulette, mostly at
Fontainebleau, and ended up broke :joy:. I realized that I&rsquo;m not good
at gambling because I&rsquo;m too optimistic, which is great for research
but not for gambling. In games like these, it&rsquo;s obvious that you&rsquo;ll
lose in the long run, but I kept thinking I could win. Perhaps I
should learn how to play poker instead (?!). Maybe next time! :smile:</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I had a nice time in Las Vegas, although at times the place felt a
bit too crazy for me. I loved my experience at Black Hat USA. I
enjoyed presenting my research, meeting people, and learning about
the latest security trends in research and industry. It definitely
motivated me to work harder on my research and return to Las Vegas as
a speaker again!</p>
