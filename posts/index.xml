      <description>Time flies in graduate school! Having spent 3.5 years as a PhD student, one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that I should be super-efficient in managing my time and energy.
I&amp;rsquo;m not someone you&amp;rsquo;d label as &amp;ldquo;born productive&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m a typical &amp;ldquo;P&amp;rdquo;-type person according to Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)&amp;ndash;indicative of a spontaneous and flexible nature. As many P-type people do, I&amp;rsquo;m prone to distraction and have difficulty in sticking to routines. Daily to-do lists or planners are ways to self-torture by confining free will into a fixed schedule.</description>

      <description>Introduction In recent years, emerging technology in Machine Learning and Large Language Model (LLM) had led to the development of ML/LLM-powered applications. One of the popular service for ML/LLM application is Hugging Face. In this post, I would like to describe the potential security risks in current Hugging Face, especially in Spaces.
Hugging Face Hugging Face is a AI community that provides a lot of machine learning models, datasets, and applications.</description>

      <description>Intro In the first year of my Ph.D, I ambitiously began a research on protecting the Linux kernel against data-only attacks. My research especially focused on protecting security-critical objects and pointers leveraging the ARM&amp;rsquo;s upcoming hardware security features (PAC and MTE).
Building such a kernel hardening system required me to tackle several key issues:
Cross-compiling the kernel (X86 -&amp;gt; ARM64) Cross-module kernel analysis Linux kernel instrumentation Connecting the cross-module analysis with kernel build system.</description>
